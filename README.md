# Chatter (An open source clone of t3.chat)
This is the open source repo for chatter.
The frontend (chatter) and the backend (backend) is here for contributors to go through and edit easily.

The repo also features a BYOK feature where you can easily use your own keys for inference when you want.

## Chatter (Frontend)
The frontend is written using nuxt. I got tired of the next alternatives. I think Nuxt is a really cool framework and needs more publicity here.
You can fork the chatter folder if you want to contribute to the frontend alone for your favorite design additions.

If you are not familiar with nuxt however I can guarantee it is easy to start and a breath of fresh air as well, you can get started from the link below:
### [Nuxt: Get started](https://nuxt.com/)

If you are used to nuxt however, the readme in the folder contains a readme to help you get started in developing or contributing to chatter.
Have fun.

## Backend (Backend)

The backend is written in fastapi and would require knowledge in python to get started to contribute.
There is a readme file as well that shows the steps in installing and or contributing to the folder repo as well.

If you are not familiar with fastapi the resources are below for you to use:
